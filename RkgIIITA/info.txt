I have understood every topics i FOSS workshop.
However due to lack of practice i am yet to have a  command in git.
Ans.
The use of git/github is to work in a project in a team and without keeping all versions in the local system, we can keep all versions in the remote repo.
And we can also work in a separate banch for new feature/experiment without harming base version.
